### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

Lab 11, part 2, is one of my favorites because the Hi-Lo game was something we coded before and then now it's better and more evolved than when we originally made it. I noticed it the moment we coded a way to make the number we were guessing random rather than us setting it up.

* Lab 4 

Another one of my favorites is lab 4, part 1. The reason why is because of how useful I thought converting ml to tsp, Tbsp, oz, and cups was since I cook and bake. I should come back to this lab to add a way to convert cups to grams because of the times I need that when I'm baking. 

* Lab 8 

The last lab I thought of when going over my favorites was Lab 8 part 2. I like this one solely because I thought it was creative to draw something using code. I wonder if there would be other ways to draw other shapes.
